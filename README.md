# 4get-hijacked
4get that doesn't suck? 

Routes [4get](https://git.lolcat.ca/lolcat/4get) engines through a PHP sidecar for fast and parallel use as SearXNG engines. (aka 4get results 4 Searxng)

Feats:
 - Allows 4get engines to be used in parallel (not normally possible)
 - Minimal overhead to stay fast, beat some of Searxng's own engine equivalents as well as tested 4get instances.
 - 4get's rich meta data scraping is normalized into compatible Searxng result types. (answer boxes, info boxes, search suggestions, prepended directly into snippets, etc.)
 - no core modifications to 4get/searxng
 - 4get cloned during deployment for upstream engine fixes
 - literally doesn't even run 4get itself
 - Searxng search parameters preserved where possible, capabilities vary by 4get engine (time range, language, country, safe search)
 - 4get engine specifc params are settable in Settings.yml for the given engine, blind injection to support any known 4get engine specific param. (eg. Brave engine can take a spellcheck parameter, `fg_spellcheck: true` in the Settings.yml engine block will enable it)
 - containerized for super easy installing/updating

## Structure
```
searx/engines/
  *-4get.py                    # Searxng engine wrappers
  fourget_hijacker_client.py   # param/result normalization

sidecar/
  Dockerfile                   # clones 4get, installs curl-impersonate
  entrypoint.sh                # patches UA to match TLS fingerprint
  src/
    harness.php                # POST endpoint to return the 4get results
    mock.php                   # backend class, proxy, APCu state
    filters.php                # exposes 4get engine filters
    dummy_lib/                 # null includes for 4get paths

docker-compose.yml             # full stack example: searxng + valkey + hijacker sidecar
settings-additions.yml         # Engine configs blocks needed for Searxng's settings.yml
```

## Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Test The Sidecar

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8081/harness.php \
  -d '{"engine":"google","params":{"s":"test"}}'
```

## Engines
google, brave, duckduckgo, yandex, wiby, marginalia, curlie, crowdview... (I use these frequently with no issues)
All of the current 4get engines, like 35 at the moment, some are broken. lolcat, pls fix.

## Steal Even More 4get Engines Why Not
1. Ensure engine exists in 4get master repo scrapers folder, note exact name.
2. Copy another engine's stub to `searx/engines/{exact-engine-name}-4get.py`
3. Update the categories array with Searxng related categories that the 4get engine supports.
4. Add config to `settings-additions.yml`

## Notes
- 4get cloned at build from `git.lolcat.ca/lolcat/4get`
- curl-impersonate for additional stealth (method copied from 4get)
- supports pagination tokens using hash lookup in sidecar
- `FOURGET_PROXIES` env: `ip:port,ip:port:user:pass` (untested proxy rotation, my Hetzner deploy with a couple users doesn't really get engine blocks/captchas)
