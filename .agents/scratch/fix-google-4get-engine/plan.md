## Research Log

### Repository Structure
First, I need to explore the repository structure to understand the layout and locate the `google-4get.py` file.

### Check for `fourget_hijacker_client` Module
Next, I will check if the `fourget_hijacker_client` module exists in the repository or needs to be installed.

### Install Missing Module
If the module is not available, I will install it using `pip`.

### Verify the Fix
Finally, I will verify the fix by running the application and ensuring the `google-4get` engine loads successfully.
